//version js manages git operations. Put very often. Maybe have it adapt to memory usage. If you're using 5% of system memory, save a lot, if you're using 50% of system memory, put only when user tells you to. 
//I think when the user Starts changing the files, a little box will pop up saying "Name for Changes:" And when you set that name, it will be changed in the meta.json. So whatever buffer you put in the Codemirror, to save after inactivity / every minute / every 500 keystrokes.  
//I'm pretty sure there's a way to collapse multiple git commits into one. So if you have 40 git commits for a relatively small change, you can just have an option, say, when you finish a task and are ready to collapse commits, you just click a butotn.
